# Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon

## AWS Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree

## Overview

We create a Kaggle account, download the Bike Sharing Demand dataset, and train a model using AutoGluon.

After we complete the first workflow, we will iterate on the process by trying to improve our score. This will be accomplished by adding more features to the dataset and tuning some of the hyperparameters available with AutoGluon.

Finally we submit all our work and write a report detailing which methods provided the best score improvement and why. A template of the report can be found [here](report-template.md).


* Visit the [Kaggle Bike Sharing Demand Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bike-sharing-demand) page. There you will see the overall details about the competition including overview, data, code, discussion, leaderboard, and rules. You will primarily be focused on the data and ranking sections.

### Dependencies

```
Python 3.7
MXNet 1.8
Pandas >= 1.2.4
AutoGluon 0.2.0 
```

For local development, you will need to setup a jupyter lab instance.
* Follow the [jupyter install](https://jupyter.org/install.html) link for best practices to install and start a jupyter lab instance.
* If you have a python virtual environment already installed you can just `pip` install it.
```
pip install jupyterlab
```
* There are also docker containers containing jupyter lab from [Jupyter Docker Stacks](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Project Instructions

1. Create an account with Kaggle.
2. Download the Kaggle dataset using the kaggle python library.
3. Train a model using AutoGluon’s Tabular Prediction and submit predictions to Kaggle for ranking.
4. Use Pandas to do some exploratory analysis and create a new feature, saving new versions of the train and test dataset.
5. Rerun the model and submit the new predictions for ranking.
6. Tune at least 3 different hyperparameters from AutoGluon and resubmit predictions to rank higher on Kaggle.
7. Write up a report on how improvements (or not) were made by either creating additional features or tuning hyperparameters, and why you think one or the other is the best approach to invest more time in.
